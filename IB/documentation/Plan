1.
strategy : pairs
trading vehicles : commodity ETFs
time horizon : days, weeks

2.
non random price behavior : 
commodities markets are often moving randomly in relation to each other.  combinations
of markets may begin to move in tandem as a result of some event.

3. proof
pairs of securities will have a neutral correlation most of the time.  at other times
they'll become significantly positively or negatively correlated.

4. trading rules:
- determine all pairs of securities where correlation is significantly higher 
than normal
	- compare 60 day correlation coefficient average to 45 hour 
	- correlation rules
		- (-.2) < long term coef < .2
		- (-.9) > short term < .9
	
- trade in clips, pyramid up
	- 1 clip = 5% of total account value per pair
	- max position : 5 clips
	
- when having position
	- how do i know when i'm right?
		- if profit
			- add another clip
		- if loss > 4.35% on either side from highest point
			- close out both positions
		- recalculate 45 hour correlation
			- if lower than threshold close out position
			
- pay attention to correlation momentum
	- if it's going the other way perhaps not worth trading.
		
- use moving average?
	- use sma long term?
	- ema for short term?	


5. awkward spots
	- correlation is good, but trends change direction
		- if not closed out
			- leave position until closed out or correlation turns bad
		- if closed out
			- see if it turns into a trend
				- if so then re-enter using trading rules
	- correlation is good, market turns choppy, but not closed out
		- stay in, leave original exit point
	- one's a winner, the other a loser
		- keep position until closed out
	- correlation high, correlation strength decreasing
		- get out if below threshold
