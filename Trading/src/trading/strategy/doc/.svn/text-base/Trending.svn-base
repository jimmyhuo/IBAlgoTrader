This strategy calculates the moving average over a certain number of days using
the daily closing price.  The long term trend is specified from this analysis.  If percent
change direction of the SMA, over x number of days is strong enough, then the trend
is labeled as bull or bear.

The moving average is also calculated for the short term, using hourly prices.  The percent
change is also calculated to determine the trend type.

To enter a position the long term trend must be bull or bear, and not in the middle.  The
short term trend can be anything except the exact opposite of the long term trend.  That is,
it cannot be bull when long term is bear.  But, it can be a weak bull (trend types are 
parameterized).

Once a position is entered a failed trade is closed out when:
	- the long term trend type changes
	- get stopped out
		- initial stop % parameterized

A winning position is closed out when:
	- long term trend type changes
	- get stopped out
		- existing stop % parameterized

The above is still valid and correct, and will be applied to  all subscribed securities.  The problem 
is that the majority of these ETF's are closely correlated to each other.  Thus, there is a lack of 
diversification and an increase in risk even when taking positions across multiple tickers.

The new change is to subscribe to an all-world ETF.  This ETF can also be traded on it's own and
will take the place of trading ETF's that are correlated with each other.  As for the other securities, 
a rule will be implemented: any national ETF must be not be correlated with the all-world ETF.

For any national ETF
 	- correlation over past 10 trading days must be neutral
